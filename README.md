# The utilizeR R package

This package aims to bundles a lot of my not-work-related workflows together in one place. Also i wanted to add version control to get rid of copy and pasting.

It contains the following things

- **Functions** which i have written and using a lot.
- **GGPlot Templates and Themes** For things i regulary use.
- **Quarto Templates** For documents i regulary use. (e.g. Project Reports, Presentations, Lab Protocols etc.)
